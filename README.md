  # User Experience

  - ### Mobile users found it difficult to use the signup form, to solve it i changed it to a different page.
  - ### Users found it hard to read the text placed ontop of the images, which were at first black. I fixed this by changing the color of the text to white instead.

  # Bugs and Errors

  - ## Solved

  - ### When adapting the site for mobile i had multiple issues with the signup form not scaling properly, i solved this by providing a link to a different site with the signup form.
  - ### Had problems with the header not following when scrolling, i solved this by giving the header and id and putting the position to fixed.

   ## Unsolved

  # User Experience

  - ### Mobile users found it difficult to use the signup form, to solve it i changed it to a different page.
  - ### Users found it hard to read the text placed ontop of the images, which were at first black. I fixed this by changing the color of the text to white instead.

  &nbsp;

  # Bugs and Errors

  - ## Solved

  - ### When adapting the site for mobile i had multiple issues with the signup form not scaling properly, i solved this by putting the form under the image next to it when on mobile.
  - ### Had problems with the header not following when scrolling, i solved this by giving the header and id and putting the position to fixed.
  - ### Accesibility was at 80% due to the size of the images. I solved this by replacing all the images of ones with a lower resolution.

  - ## Unsolved

  - ### No unsolved bugs.
